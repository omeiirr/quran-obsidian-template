# Quran Obsidian Template

I created this template to take notes while studying Quran, using the popular note-taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

The Ayats are grouped in folders by Surah, and each Ayat is in a separate file inside the folder.
For example, the second Ayat of the last Surah appears as `114-2.md`
```
Surahs
| ...
| - 113 Al-Falaq (The Daybreak)
|   - 113-1.md
|   ...
| - 114 An-Nas (Mankind)
|   - 114-1.md
|   - 114-2.md
|   ...
```
